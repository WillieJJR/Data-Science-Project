# Time Series Modeling/Forecasting Project

This project uses the World Wide Imports (WWI) DataWarehouse. The goal is to perform ETL, Explore, Analyze, and Predict, using Data Analytics/Science tools, to derive insights that will lead to decisions that can enhance the future-state of the business. 

Within this project:



I used SQL for data modeling, ETL, and data aggregation


I used PowerBI for Data Visualization and analysis


I used R Programming for more advanced data manipulation, data transformation, and predictive modeling/analytics


The overall goal - to provide descriptive and predictive analytics to provide recommendations for business change - was achieved and presented via PowerPoint
